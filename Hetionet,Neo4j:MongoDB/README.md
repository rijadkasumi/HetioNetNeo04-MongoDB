Project 1 - Hetionet

Packages used to run the program:
Python, MongoDB, Neo4j, PyMongo, Py2neo.
Program was built using Visual Studio Code, all extensions were installed in vs code such as MongoDB and Neo4j. 
Neo4j is opened in the Neo4j Desktop and connected through a uri connection bolt://localhost:7687 followed by the user: neo4j and password: bigdata123

To run the program both databases need to be activated and connected (mongoDB needs to be reconnected every time the compiler is closed), after that we enter the command ‘python3 main.py’ which executes the program and query, prompting the user to enter a disease name followed by a compound name.
